# secure-text-over-untrusted-chat
Sometimes, certain messaging tools do not support end-to-end encryption. In extreme situations, you may have no choice but to use these insecure messaging apps. To achieve end-to-end encryption on such tools, I developed this program. It has two modes: RSA and DH (Diffie-Hellman). By simply exchanging your public keys, you can securely communicate with each other using encrypted text.
